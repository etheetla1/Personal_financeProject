 Project Summary
 The Personal Finance Manager App is designed to help users track and manage their personal
 finances efficiently. It will offer a user-friendly interface for logging income, expenses, savings,
 and investments. The app aims to provide users with an overview of their financial health,
 insights into their spending patterns, and tools to help them achieve their financial goals.
 Key features of the app include:- Income & Expense Tracker: A module where users can record their daily income and
 expenditures.- Savings Goal Manager: Users can set specific savings goals and track their progress visually.- Budget Creation: Allows users to create a monthly or weekly budget and track their adherence
 to it.- Financial Summary Dashboard: A visual dashboard presenting income vs. expenses, savings
 goals, and investments, using charts and graphs.- User Privacy & Security: All financial data will be securely stored locally or in the cloud, with
 encryption options for sensitive information.
 The app is designed for people looking to improve their financial management. It helps users
 track spending, view recent transactions, and set achievable savings goals, all through a
 user-friendly interface. With visual tools like graphs and progress bars, the app makes it easy to
 monitor financial health and stay on top of personal budgeting.

 Number and Nameof Unique Screens
 1. Login/Sign-up Screen- Allows users to create an account or log in. Users may opt for biometric login (e.g.,
 fingerprint/face ID).
 2. Dashboard Screen- Displays a summary of income, expenses, and savings goals.- Graphs and charts showing monthly or weekly financial performance.
 3. Income & Expense Tracker Screen- Users can manually enter their income and expenses here.- Categories for expenses (e.g., groceries, rent, utilities) with icons for easy identification.
 4. Budget Management Screen- Users can create and manage their budgets, with real-time tracking of budget limits & expenses.
5. Savings Goal Screen- Users can set savings goals and track their progress. Visual indicators such as progress bars will
 show how close they are to reaching their targets.
 6. Profile & Settings Screen- Includes user profile information, financial settings, data export, and app preferences (e.g., dark
 mode).
 Functionality & User Experience (UX)
 Proposed Use Cases for Screen Transitions:
 1. Login/Sign-up to Dashboard- After logging in or signing up, the user is taken to the dashboard showing their financial
 summary.
 2. Dashboard to Income & Expense Tracker- Users can navigate to the income & expense tracker by tapping the 'Add Transaction' button.
 3. Dashboard to Budget Management- Tapping on the 'Manage Budget' section directs the user to the budget management screen,
 where they can adjust their monthly budget.
 4. Dashboard to Savings Goal- Tapping on the 'Savings Goals' section allows users to add or update their goals and track their
 progress.
 5. Profile/Settings- Accessible from the menu, this screen lets users change personal and financial settings and
 export data.
 Iterative Design
 Iterative Design involves continuously refining and improving the app through cycles of
 user feedback, testing, and updates. For the financial management app:
 1. Initial Prototype: Build basic features (login, dashboard, expense tracker). Test
 usability and gather feedback.
 2. Refinement:Basedonfeedback, simplify processes like budget setting and improve
 navigation. Test again with a larger group.
 3. FeatureExpansion: Addadvancedfeatures (biometric login, reports). Ensure new
 additions integrate seamlessly.
 4. Polish&Visuals: Enhance design aesthetics and test for improved user
 engagement.
5. OngoingUpdates:Continuously gather feedback, fix bugs, and release new features
 to keep the app user-centric.
 This process ensures a user-friendly, evolving app that adapts to user needs over time.
 Test Cases and Approach to Refining Improvements
 1. Initial User Testing: We will conduct user testing with a focus group to gather feedback on
 usability, particularly for navigating between screens and using key features like income/expense
 tracking and budget management.
 2. User Feedback Loop: Based on feedback, we will iteratively improve UI layouts, simplify data
 input, and enhance the user experience.
 3. Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements: We'll conduct multiple rounds of testing to identify
 and resolve any performance issues, such as slow load times or crashes.
 4. Final Usability Testing: Before the final submission, weâ€™ll ensure that the app is bug-free and
 offers a smooth user experience across all functionalities.
 Tools & Technologies- Framework: Flutter (for cross-platform development on iOS and Android)- Backend: Firebase (for user authentication and database)- Local Storage: SQLite (for offline use)- Version Control: GitHub (for source control and collaboration)- Testing: Flutter Test, Integration Tests, and manual user testing
